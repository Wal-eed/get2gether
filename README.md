# Get2Gether

# How it works:
The website uses a React frontend to display and manage the timetable. In the demo, two dummy user profiles exist on the frontend which are then used, so for the demo only, the frontend does not communicate with the backend. However, most, if not all, the functionality needed to execute interactions with the Google Calendar API such as fetching their calendar, storing their free times, and adding a new event upon event confirmation has been implemented in the backend, so please feel free to take a look. 

At the end once users have filled in the prefrences, the times are highlighted from least common to most common times, as shown by the legend in the bottom left.
